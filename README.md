## About me

  I am a musician turned software engineer. Software engineering was the perfect place to go because I am always looking to improve myself, and software engineering has never ending opportunity for growth. My dream is to make software for musicians to help their lives easier and more fulfilling. I am proficient with Python, React, Redux, Node, Express, SQL, Postgresql, and Javascript. I look forward to seeing how I grow in my career.
